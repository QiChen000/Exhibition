# Impressionism to modernism in Computational Thinking

Video: https://youtu.be/8NHUMPaVLeg 

This project explores the art forms from impressionism, cubism to abstract expressionism 
from the perspective of computational thinking. We have chosen representative paintings 
from each period for re-creation, including Monet's "Water Lilies," Picasso's "Apples," 
Kandinsky's "Composition VIII," and Jackson Pollock's "Number 23." Through AR scanning of 
paintings and interactive body sensations, people can have a deeper understanding of the 
art from different periods and gain new artistic experiences.

The artworks mentioned in the prompt were created using different techniques. Monet's 
"Water Lilies" was built using Unity to animate the lotus flower, and simulate the movement 
of the water ripples by TouchDesigner. Picasso's "Apples" was created by modeling the 
apples in Rhino and importing them into Unity for animation. Kandinsky's "Composition VIII" 
involved drawing geometric shapes in TouchDesigner and randomizing them. Finally, 
Jackson Pollock's "Number 23" was created using Leap Motion gesture recognition, allowing 
the audience to simulate the original work and create their forms.

This project was a collaboration between NaHong and me. I worked on Monet's Water 
Lilies, the Touchdesigner portion of Kandinsky's Composition No. 8, and the complete 
creation of Jackson Pollock's Number 23.
